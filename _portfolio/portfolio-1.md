title: "SEM image of Integrated Circuit for Sustaining Amplifier"
excerpt: "The IC was designed in 0.5u OnSemi 3M2P process for integration with MEMS devices operating in 10-110kHz frequency range in the same hermetic package. I was involved in the design, simulation and layout of entire chip during my visit to Case Western Reserve University in May-July, 2016. <br/><img src='sidksingh.github.io/images/Mohammad-5X-MEMS Xcvr0005.jpg'>"
