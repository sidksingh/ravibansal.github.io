This is Siddharth's home on the web! I am an Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering student at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I have been heavily involved in design of Integrated Circuits, and am currently interested in pursuing research in Nanotechnology that can usher us into the next generation of computing and technology.
