excerpt: 'Emerging memristive-crossbar memory technology can be promising for computationally-expensive analog pattern-matching tasks. It provides a new computing paradigm, enabling calculations to be performed in the same chips where data is stored. However, degradation in the performance of the RCM is observed due to parasitic and terminal resistances, which we have demonstrated in this paper. A novel current mode circuit has been proposed to effectively tackle this problem. The proposed circuit is more power efficient in comparison to its voltage mode counterparts. <br /> The paper is currently under review. The results for acceptances will be announced in January 2018.'
